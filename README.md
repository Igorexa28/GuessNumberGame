# GuessNumberGame

This game was created using Vanilla JS. Here, you can try to guess my randomly generated number from 0 to your number inclusively. There are two levels of difficulty in this game. First - easy, and second - difficult. The difference between them is that you will see various prompts. For instance, if we choose easy mode, then you will see 'Higher' or 'Lower'. If it is difficult mode, then you will see cold, hot, very hot, etc... I hope, you will enjoy my game, have a good time)
